About this project:

A simple time-travelling Ferrari website.  Not particularly packed with funtionality but a dive back into JavaScript and React after quite a while.

What I'd change:

The website looks crummy on mobile - I'll try and come back to a fix this or bootstrap it so it's fully responsive when I have my CSS knowledge under my belt.
