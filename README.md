About this project:
A fairly simple React website, whilst it's not particularly packed with funtionality it served as a dive back into JavaScript and React and my first time using react-reveal and material-ui.

What I'd change:
+ It's unfortunately not responsive, this is something that I will definitely have to come back to and fix - ideally by revamping the css entirely and using bootstrap which would also serve as a learning process.
+ The carousel jsx could be cleaned up.
+ Style the sidebar
+ Make it look more 80s/outrun-esque
